String is a Character Array

In other words, a string is a sequence of characters terminated with a null character "\0"

example:

char c[] = "c string";

declaring a string 
 
 char s[5];

 // Initialise strings

 char c[5] = "abcd";
 char c[50] = "abgdg";
 char c[] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'};
 char c[5] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', '\0'};

 char c[5] = "abcde";

 We can use a scanf to read a string from the user:

 Scanf reads the string until it encounters a whitespace;
 
 We can use fgets()  to read a line of the string.
 An we can use puts() to display the string.
